The architecture of the DBMS influences its design. Numerous PCs, web servers, database servers, and other network-connected components are handled by the standard client/server design.
Numerous PCs and a workstation connected by a network make up the client/server architecture.
The way users connect to the database in order to complete their requests determines the architecture of the DBMS.

Database architecture can be viewed as single-tier or multi-tier. But there are actually two types of database architectures: 2-tier architecture and 3-tier architecture.

DBMS Architecture Types:-

1 Tier Architecture
2 Tier Architecture
3 Tier Architecture

1 Tier Architecture:

In this architecture, the database is directed directly to the user. This means that users can sit directly into the DBMS and use it.
All changes here will be made directly to the storage itself. It lacks basic tools for end users. 
1-Tier architecture is used for native application development and programmers can directly communicate with data to achieve fast response.

2 Tier Architecture:

2-tier architecture is the same as client-server. In a two-tier architecture, clients can communicate directly with server-side databases. 
APIs such as ODBC and JDBC are used for this interaction. 
The user interface and application run on the client side.
Server is responsible for providing server-side query processing and transaction management. 
To communicate with the DBMS, the client application contacts the server side.

3- Tier Architecture:

3-tier architecture includes another layer of clients and servers. In this model, the client cannot communicate directly with the server. 
The client application interacts with the application server, which continues with the database. 
End users are not aware of the existence of data outside the application server. The database remains anonymous to other users outside the application. 
For large web applications, 3-tier architecture is used.
