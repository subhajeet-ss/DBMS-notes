Types of Keys in Relational Model

Primary Key
Foreign Key
Composite Key
Unique Key

Primary Key:

A column or columns is called primary key (PK) that uniquely identifies each row in the table.

The primary key checks the integrity of the table. 
Primary keys always contain unique information. 
The key length cannot exceed 900 bytes.
Primary keys cannot contain invalid values.
Primary keys cannot be equal.
A table can only have one primary key constraint.

Foreign Key

In a relational database, a foreign key is a field or column used to establish a relationship between two tables.
A foreign key in one table used to point primary key in another table.
It acts as a cross-reference between tables because it references the primary key of another table, thereby establishing a link between them.

Composite Key

A composite key is a combination of two or more rows in a table that can be used to identify each row in the table. 
Uniqueness is guaranteed when rows are combined, but uniqueness is not recognized when used alone. 
Sometimes more than one attributes are needed to uniquely identify an entity. 
A primary key that is made by the combination of more than one attribute is known as a composite key.

Unique Key

A unique key is a set of one or more fields/rows in a table that is used to identify unique data in a database. 
It is like a primary key but it can only accept one null value and cannot have equality. 
Both unique keys and primary keys provide authentication to a unique party or set. 
There is a particularly important consideration in the key limit.
