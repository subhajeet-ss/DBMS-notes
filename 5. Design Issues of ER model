Here, we will discuss the basic design issues of an ER database schema in the following points:

Use of Entity Set vs Attributes:

The use of methods or attributes depends on the nature of the real-world business model and the context associated with the attributes. 
The error occurs when the user uses the primary key of one setting as an attribute of another setting. 
Instead, he needs to use the right relationship to do this. 
Also, the main character is implicit in the relationship set, but we show it in the relationship sets.

Use of Entity Set vs. Relationship Sets:

It is difficult to determine whether the object can best be expressed through process or through social process. 
To understand and determine proper usage, users need to be informed of the relationships that describe the activities that occur between sites.
If there is a requirement of representing the object as a relationship set, then its better not to mix it with the entity set.

Placing Relationship Attributes

The cardinality ratios can become an affective measure in the placement of the relationship attributes. 
Therefore, it is better to associate the attributes of one-to-one or one-to-many relationships with all participating entities rather than relationships. 
The decision to assign the character as a relationship or entity attribute should be characteristic of the real world as a model.
