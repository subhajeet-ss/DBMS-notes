Normalization:-
 
Normalization is the process of organizing information in a database. 
Normalization is used to reduce redundancy in a relationship or a group of relationships. 
It is also used to remove unwanted features such as adding, modifying and deleting exceptions. 
Normalization splits a large table into smaller tables and joins them using relationships. Regular records are used to reduce duplication in database tables.
