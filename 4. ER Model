ER Model

ER model stands for Entity-Relationship Model. It is a very advanced data structure. 
This model is used to define data and relationships for a system.
It develops a conceptual design for the database. It also develops a very simple and easy to design view of data.
In the ER model, the database structure is defined as a diagram called an entity-relationship diagram.

Entity:

An entity can be any object, category, person or place. In an ER diagram, entity can be represented as rectangles.

Entity Set:-
An Entity is an object of Entity Type and a set of all entities is called an entity set.

Attribute:
Attributes are used to describe the properties of an entity. Eclipse is used to represent an attribute.

Relationship:
Relationships are used to define relations between entities. Rhombus or diamond shape is used to represent relationships.

Why use ER diagram:-

1. The ER diagram is used to represent the E-R structure in data so that it is easier to transform data into relationships (tables). 
2. ER diagrams are designed to be modeled in the real world, which makes them useful. 
3. ER imaging requires no technical knowledge or hardware support. 
4. The graphics are very easy to understand and easy to install even for new users. 
5. Provides problem solving process for visual information. 

Symbols used in the ER model:-

Rectangle: Represents the area in the ER model.
Lines: Lines represent locations and settings along with other types of relationships.
Diamond: Diamonds represent Relationships among Entities.
Lines: Lines represent attributes to entities and entity sets with other relationship types.
Double Ellipse: Double Ellipses represent Multi-Valued Attributes.
Double Rectangle: A double Rectangle represents a Weak Entity.
