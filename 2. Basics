DBMS (Database Management System)
A database management system is software used to store and retain information. For example Oracle, MySQL etc.; These are some popular DBMS tools. 

The main role of DBMS

DBMS provides interfaces for various operations such as creation, deletion, and update. 
DBMS allows users to create data according to their needs. 
The DBMS accepts requests from applications and provides certain information through transactions.
A DBMS consists of groups of programs that run according to user instructions. It ensures the security of the database.

Advantages of DBMS:-

Controls Redundancy: Stores all data in a single database so data redundancy can be controlled. 
Data Sharing: Authorized users can share information with multiple users. 
Backup: Provides backup and recovery of subsystems. This recovery automatically creates data from system failure and restores data when necessary. 
Multiple User Interfaces: It provides different types of user interfaces such as GUI and Application Programming Interfaces.

Drawbacks of DBMS:-

It uses a lot of disk space, has large memory and has high performance. 
It requires a high-speed database and large memory to run DBMS software, so the cost is higher. 
It creates additional complexity and requirements.

RDBMS:-

The term RDBMS is called "relational database management system". It is represented as a table consisting of rows and columns. 
RDBMS is based on a relational model; It was suggested by E. F. Codd.

A relational database consists of the following:

Table
Record/Tuple
Field/Column Name/Attribute
Instance
Mode
Key

RDBMS Secures the data, a tabular DBMS that maintains its integrity, correctness, and consistency.


Database Languages in DBMS:-

DBMS has the necessary languages ​​and interfaces to express database queries and updates. 
Database languages ​​can be used to read, store and manipulate data in databases.

Types of Database Languages:-

DDL

DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is used to define the database structure or schema.
