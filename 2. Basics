DBMS (Database Management System)
A database management system is software used to store and retain information. For example Oracle, MySQL etc.; These are some popular DBMS tools. 

The main role of DBMS

DBMS provides interfaces for various operations such as creation, deletion, and update. 
DBMS allows users to create data according to their needs. 
The DBMS accepts requests from applications and provides certain information through transactions.
A DBMS consists of groups of programs that run according to user instructions. It ensures the security of the database.

Advantages of DBMS:-

Controls Redundancy: Stores all data in a single database so data redundancy can be controlled. 
Data Sharing: Authorized users can share information with multiple users. 
Backup: Provides backup and recovery of subsystems. This recovery automatically creates data from system failure and restores data when necessary. 
Multiple User Interfaces: It provides different types of user interfaces such as GUI and Application Programming Interfaces.

Drawbacks of DBMS:-

It uses a lot of disk space, has large memory and has high performance. 
It requires a high-speed database and large memory to run DBMS software, so the cost is higher. 
It creates additional complexity and requirements.

RDBMS:-

The term RDBMS is called "relational database management system". It is represented as a table consisting of rows and columns. 
RDBMS is based on a relational model; It was suggested by E. F. Codd.

A relational database consists of the following:

Table
Record/Tuple
Field/Column Name/Attribute
Instance
Mode
Key

RDBMS Secures the data, a tabular DBMS that maintains its integrity, correctness, and consistency.


Database Languages in DBMS:-

DBMS has the necessary languages ​​and interfaces to express database queries and updates. 
Database languages ​​can be used to read, store and manipulate data in databases.

Types of Database Languages:-

DDL

DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is used to define the database structure or schema. 
In the database, it is used to create schema, tables, indexes, constraints, etc.
The skeleton of the file can be created using DDL statements.
It is used to store metadata such as data definitions, number of tables and schemas, names, indexes, rows in each table, constraints, etc.

Below are some functions in DDL:

Create: Used to create objects in the database.
Alter: Used to change the format of the file. 
Drop: Used to delete items in the database. 
Truncate: Used to delete all records in the table. 
Rename: Used to rename items.

DML

DML stands for Data Manipulation Language. It is used to track and manage information in the database. It manages user requests.

Here are some tasks that come under DML:

Select: used to retrieve information from the database. 
Add: Used to add data to the table. 
Update: Used to update existing data in the table. 
Delete: Used to delete all records in the table. 
Merge: Perform the UPSERT operation, that is, the insertion or update operation. 
Call: Used to call a query query or Java subroutine. 
Lock table: manage concurrency.

DCL

DCL stands for Data Control Language. It is used to retain or store information.
DCL execution is transactional. There are also rollback parameters.

Some of the functions in DCL are:

Grant: Used to allow users to access the database. 
Revoke: Used to revoke user permissions.

TCL

TCL is used to run the changes made by the DML statement. TCL can be grouped into a logical transaction.

Here are some tasks that come under TCL:

Commit: It is used to save the transaction on the database.
Rollback: It is used to restore the database to the original since the last Commit.
