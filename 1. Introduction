Definition:-

The database is a collection of inter-related information which is utilized to recover, embed and erase the information proficiently. 
It is utilized to organize the information in the frame of a table, construction, sees, and reports, etc. Utilizing the database, one can effectively recover, embed, and erase the data.

Database Administration System
Database administration framework is a computer program which is utilized to oversee the database. For case: MySQL, Prophet, etc are a exceptionally well known commercial database which is utilized in distinctive applications.
DBMS gives an interface to perform different operations like database creation, putting away information in it, overhauling information, making a table in the database and a parcel more.
It gives security and security to the database. In the case of numerous clients, it too keeps up information consistency.

DBMS permits clients the taking after tasks:

Data Definition: It is utilized for creation, alteration, and evacuation of definition that characterizes the organization of information in the database.
Data Updation: It is utilized for the inclusion, adjustment, and erasure of the genuine information in the database.
Data Recovery: It is utilized to recover the information from the database which can be utilized by applications for different purposes.
User Organization: It is utilized for enrolling and checking clients, keep up information judgment, upholding information security, managing with concurrency control, observing execution and recouping data debased by startling disappointment.

Characteristics of DBMS:

It employs a computerized store set up on a server to store and oversee the information.
It can give a clear and consistent see of the handle that controls data.
It contains programed reinforcement and recuperation procedures.
It contains Corrosive properties which keep up information in a solid state in case of failure.
It can diminish the complex relationship between data. 
It is utilized to back control and handling of data. 
It is utilized to give security of data. 
It can see the database from distinctive perspectives concurring to the prerequisites of the client.

Advantages of DBMS:

Controls database repetition: It can control information repetition since it stores all the information in one single database record and that recorded information is put in the database.
Data sharing: In DBMS, the authorized clients of an organization can share the information among different users.
Easy Maintenaince: It can be effectively viable due to the centralized nature of the database system.
Reduce time: It diminishes advancement time and support need.
Backup: It gives reinforcement and recuperation subsystems which make programed reinforcement of information from equipment and computer program disappointments and reestablishes the information if required. 
Multiple client interface: It gives diverse sorts of client interfacing like graphical client interfacing, application program interfacing.

Drawbacks of DBMS
Cost of Equipment and Computer program: It requires a tall speed of information processor and huge memory measure to run DBMS software.
Size: It involves an expansive space of disks and huge memory to run them efficiently.
Complexity: Database framework makes extra complexity and requirements.
Higher impact of failure: Failure is highly impacted the database because in most of the organization, all the data stored in a single database and if the database is damaged due to electric failure or database corruption then the data may be lost forever.

Different sorts of DBMS
Relational DBMS (RDBMS): RDBMS stores information in tables with lines and columns and employs SQL (Structured Query Language) to oversee the data.
OODBMS stores information as objects and can be manipulated by utilizing useful expressions.
NoSQL DBMS: A NoSQL DBMS stores information in non-relational information structures, such as key-value sets, document-based models, or chart models.
